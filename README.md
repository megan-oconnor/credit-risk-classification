# Overview of Analysis
Trained and evaluated a model to classify borrower loan risk using historical lending data.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Created a Logistic Regression Model and fit with the training data.
- Generated model classification predictions with the testing data.
- Evaluated model performance with a confusion matrix and classification report.

# Results
The classification report shows a high accuracy score at 99%. </br>
  - **Health Loans** The model had a precision score of .99 and recall score of 1 for this group, meaning that the model classified this group well.
  - **High-Risk Loans** The model had lower precision and recall scores, .94 and .84, respectively. This means that the model had a harder time classifying these borrowers.

# Summary
The model did a better job at classifying the healthy loans than the high-risk loans.
